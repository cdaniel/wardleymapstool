Preface
-------------

There are people who understand the difference between a professional and a "professional" strategy.

If the table below does not ring a bell with you, go and check [my mapping portal](http://wardleymaps.com/learn.html) in order to gather the
minimal required knowledge (for free).



|     Strategy | Professional | "Professional"      |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------- |
|    Reasoning | Visual       | Verbal              |
| Common tools | maps         | SWOT/story telling  |
| Prepared by  | you          | consultants         |
| Price        | cheap        | very expensive      |



However, if you know what a Wardley Map is, I have a good news for you - I wrote a tool that makes map creation much easier.
You can now easily create map, share it with someone, download as png, or create variants and evaluate them.
 
If you still are not sure whether this tool is for you, check [the Atlas live instance](https://atlas.wardleymaps.com).

Running your own instance
-------------------------
There is a common bias that novel & business critical tool must have big brands guarding them, because it warrants that those tools will not dissappear over night leaving users in the lurch. That is just plain wrong. If you would like to have your own instance of Atlas, you can get it running in nearly no time. Instructions are available on a [project wiki] (https://github.com/cdaniel/wardleymapstool/wiki/Running-your-own-instance). Do not worry, it is not complicated.
